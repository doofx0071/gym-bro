## üìã Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: OTP Verification Runtime Error ‚úÖ

**Problem:**
- User enters OTP code and clicks "Verify"
- Error appears: "An unexpected response was received from the server"
- User must reload page (F5) to see they're logged in
- Poor user experience

**Root Cause:**
- `verifyOtp` server action used `redirect()` which throws an error in Next.js
- Client-side code didn't handle the redirect properly
- Server actions that use `redirect()` cause runtime errors

**Solution:**
- Changed `verifyOtp` to return `{ success: true }` instead of calling `redirect()`
- Updated client-side handler to check for success and redirect manually
- Added success toast notification

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/auth/actions.ts` - Changed return value
- `src/components/auth-form.tsx` - Added success handling and redirect

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ No more runtime errors
- ‚úÖ Smooth redirect to dashboard after OTP verification
- ‚úÖ Success toast notification
- ‚úÖ No page reload required

### Issue 2: Profile Page Animations & Mobile Responsiveness ‚úÖ

**Problem:**
- Profile page had fade-in animations (inconsistent with dashboard)
- Loading state returned `null` (blank screen)

**Solution:**
- Removed all `FadeIn` components and imports
- Added loading skeleton matching dashboard style (`bg-muted-foreground/20`)
- Ensured mobile responsiveness with proper spacing

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/profile/page.tsx` - Removed animations, added skeleton

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ Instant page load (no animations)
- ‚úÖ Consistent loading skeleton
- ‚úÖ Fully mobile responsive
- ‚úÖ Matches dashboard UX

### Issue 3: Settings Page Creation ‚úÖ

**Problem:**
- Settings page didn't exist
- Sidebar had a link to `/settings` but page was missing
- No sidebar layout for settings page

**Solution:**
- Created new settings page with 5 sections:
  1. **Notifications** - Email and push notification toggles
  2. **Appearance** - Dark mode toggle
  3. **Language & Region** - Display language and units
  4. **Security** - Password change

### Issue 4: Sidebar Footer - User Name & Email ‚úÖ

**Problem:**
- Sidebar footer showed "Account" instead of user's full name
- Second line showed goal instead of email address

**Solution:**
- Updated footer to fetch user data from `authUser` (Supabase auth user)
- Line 1: Full name (`firstName + lastName`) or "Account" as fallback
- Line 2: Email address or "Manage account" as fallback
- Adjusted icon size to 32px container with 16px icon (matches logo)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/app-sidebar.tsx` - Updated footer display logic

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ Shows "John Doe" (user's full name)
- ‚úÖ Shows "john@example.com" (user's email)
- ‚úÖ Graceful fallback if data not available
- ‚úÖ Icon size matches logo (32px container, 16px icon)

---

### Issue 5: Logo Stretching When Sidebar Collapsed ‚úÖ

**Problem:**
- Logo appeared stretched when sidebar was collapsed
- Size was inconsistent (48px expanded, 96px collapsed)

**Solution:**
- Set logo to consistent 32px √ó 32px in both states
- Used `object-contain` to maintain aspect ratio
- Adjusted container to `size-8` (32px) in both states
- Removed excessive padding

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/app-sidebar.tsx` - Fixed logo sizing

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ Logo is 32px √ó 32px in both expanded and collapsed states
- ‚úÖ No stretching or distortion
- ‚úÖ Proper aspect ratio maintained

### Issue 6: Loading Skeleton Consistency ‚úÖ

- Inconsistent loading states across pages

**Solution:**
- Removed `<Skeleton>` component imports
- Updated all loading states to use `bg-muted-foreground/20`
- Added `animate-pulse` for animation
- Consistent rounded corners (`rounded` for text, `rounded-lg` for cards)

**Files Modified:**

- `src/app/settings/page.tsx` - Updated loading skeleton

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ Consistent loading appearance across all pages

### Issue 7: Cursor Pointers on Interactive Elements ‚úÖ

- Inconsistent hover states

**Solution:**
- Added `cursor-pointer` class to:
  - All Switch components
  - All Label elements (for toggles)
  - All Button components
  - SidebarTrigger
  - Dropdown menu items

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/settings/page.tsx` - Added cursor pointers
- `src/app/settings/layout.tsx` - Added to SidebarTrigger
